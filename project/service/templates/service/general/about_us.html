          <p class="story-text">
            Founded in 2025 by Kim, Kim's Antiques began as a passion project born from countless hours spent wandering through flea markets and antique shops across the globe. What started as a personal fascination with historical artifacts and vintage treasures has evolved into a curated marketplace for discerning collectors and vintage enthusiasts.
          </p>
          <p class="story-text">
            We believe that every antique tells a story â€” stories of craftsmanship, history, and the lives of those who came before us. Our mission is to preserve these narratives while connecting them with people who appreciate their beauty and significance.
